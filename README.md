# Front End Test App - Matters

* to view, download and run index.html through a web browser. (If you don't have one, "npm install -g http-server" and then run "http-server ." from the root directory of this to view it at 127.0.0.1)
* uses Bootstrap 3 to provide responsive grid
* uses Bower for build dependencies

# known bugs
* drop down menu is clipped
* mobile resolution menu cuts off matters list

# To-Do list
- use javascript to launch the pop-up in a fixed position, so that it appears over and above the scrolling matters list
- change data list to select list to be compatible with Safari
- add background icons for form filters through bootstrap to match wireframe
- better position the content in small resolutions so that the navbar form doesn't overlap the content
